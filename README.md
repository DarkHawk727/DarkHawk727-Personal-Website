# DarkHawk727-Personal-Website

A personal website to showcase my projects, skills, and awards.
Most of the links will either direct to my GitHub, where all the real stuff is anyway, or my devpost, where all my hackathons are displayed.

## TODO

- Add better descriptions for the certifications/courses
- Update Skills Section
- Add all github projects?
- Make the scroll down feature work for the awards section
- Maybe add a blog section?
- Add a work & Education section like [this](https://jarin.me/)
