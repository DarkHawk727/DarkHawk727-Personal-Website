                        <strong>Work Experience</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I am currently looking for Fall 2024 (09/2024 - 12/2024) opportunities in ML & AI. Please reach out to me at <a href="mailto:arjun.sarao@uwaterloo.ca">arjun.sarao@uwaterloo.ca</a> if you have one.</li>
                            <li><i>AI Solution Specialist @ City of Hamilton ITS</i> - I made a RAG-webapp for help with RFP review. You can find the code <a href="https://github.com/DarkHawk727/YARA">here</a> (Please don't steal my OpenAI token). I also helped proof-of-concept a Generative AI-powered chatbot for the city's website.</li>
                            <li><i>Full Stack Web Developer @ Starai Tutoring</i>  - I developed the <a href="https://staraitutoring.ca/">company website</a> from scratch using <span class="skill-highlight">React</span>. I also added <span class="skill-highlight">Twilio</span> notifications for the owner and form collection via <span class="skill-highlight">Firebase</span>.</li>

                        <strong>Projects</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Honestly, the best place for viewing my projects is over at my <a href="https://www.github.com/DarkHawk727">github</a>.</li>
                            <li>That being said, some project I'm currently pretty proud of are: </li>
                            <ul>

                                <li>Blueprint - Inspired by <a href="https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/">Bryan Johnson's Blueprint</a>, this service uses LLMs to score university work. It retrieves new work from various sites, evaluates its time commitment, and schedules it into Google calendar. This removes the need for me to plan my day or decide what to do next. (Note: This program <em>doesn't do the work for me</em>, it simply estimates how long it would take <em>me</em> to do and then schedules it.) Find it <a href="https://www.github.com/DarkHawk727/Blueprint">here</a>.</li>
                                <li>Formal-Deduction - A <span class="skill-highlight">Python</span> engine for parsing, and performing inference on propositional and first order statements. You can define stuff like
                                    \(((A \land \neg B) \lor \neg C) \rightarrow ((C \leftrightarrow B) \lor \neg A)\), and it can spit out a truth table, determine its semantic value,  and let you perform syntactic transformations to it. You can also supply multiple such statements and have it determine if they are consistent, and if they are, give you a model that satisfies them. It's pretty cool. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/DarkHawk727/Formal-Deduction">here</a>.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    ARM-LEG Simulator - Another <span class="skill-highlight">Python</span> project, this one simulates the execution of a subset of ARMv7 assembly. It can simulate the execution of a program along with the state of the registers and memory at each step. It can also simulate the execution of a program with a given set of inputs. You can find it on <a href="https://www.github.com/DarkHawk727/ARM-LEG-Simulator">github</a>.
                                </li>
                                <li>For one-off scripts, I invite you to check out my <a href="https://gist.github.com/DarkHawk727">GitHub Gists</a>. They include stuff like a <a href="https://gist.github.com/DarkHawk727/4ec5bed25da96b9b8094df41e23d7c9e">Brainfuck interpreter</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/DarkHawk727/6737017a9cb032b0d867ba5a5dad7962">2-Bit Branch Prediction FSM</a>, a minimal <a href="https://www.example.com">Turing Machine Simulator</a>, and a reimplementation of <a href="">Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd</a>!</li>
                            </ul>

                        <strong> Education</strong> - As stated above, I'm currently studying Computer (Data?) Science at the University of Waterloo. Here are some of the courses I've taken:
                        <ul>
                            <li>CS 246 - Object-Oriented Software Development</li>
                            <li>CS 245 - Logic & Computation</li>
                            <li>CS 251 - Computer Organization & Design</li>
                            <li>MATH 237 - Calculus III</li>
                            <li>MATH 235 - Linear Algebra II</li>
                            <li>STAT 230 - Probability</li>
                            <li>CS 136 - Elementary Algorithm Design and Data Abstraction</li>
                            <li>CS 135 - Designing Functional Programs (The functional refers to the paradigm of the language, Racket, not designing "working" programs. Although, I suppose it does that too...)</li>
                        </ul>
                        I've been taking notes on these courses using <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. You can view them <a href="https://quartz.arjunsarao.dev">here</a>.
